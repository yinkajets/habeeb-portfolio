    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Habeeb Adenle is a Ph.D. candidate in Physics Engineering at Louisiana Tech University, specializing in High Energy Physics with a research focus on the ATLAS experiment at CERN. Under the mentorship of Dr. Lee Sawyer, Habeeb's doctoral research explores jet cleaning and cell timing calibration, contributing to improved event reconstruction and data analysis at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).

Habeeb has over two years of experience in measuring Standard Model particles and searching for signals beyond the Standard Model (BSM). His recent work involves analyzing proton-proton collisions, developing consolidated jet cleaning recommendations for Run 2 and Run 3 data, and studying timing inefficiencies and pileup mitigation strategies. He actively contributes to the ATLAS Jet and MET Physics Object groups and regularly presents updates in Jet Def+MC subgroup meetings.

In addition to his core Ph.D. research, Habeeb has participated in cutting-edge machine learning workshops through the US ATLAS Early Career Scientist group, including CAMPFIRE at Argonne National Lab and ML4FP at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. He was part of the team project “Identification of Z → ee Process Using Machine Learning,” exploring classification algorithms for physics object identification.

Before joining Louisiana Tech, Habeeb earned a Master’s degree in Applied Physics from the University of Lagos, Nigeria, where he investigated ionospheric irregularities affecting space communication systems. He also volunteers as a peer reviewer for Radio Science (AGU) and contributes to collaborative space physics research with Lagos State University.

Habeeb is passionate about advancing particle physics, mentoring early-career researchers, and promoting African excellence in STEM. He currently serves as President of the African Students Association at Louisiana Tech University, fostering cultural exchange and academic growth within the university community. </p>
