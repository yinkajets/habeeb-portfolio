  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <img src="assets/mypics.png" alt="Habeeb Adenle" style="float: right; width: 200px; height: auto; margin-left: 20px; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 0 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">


  <p>Habeeb Adenle is a Ph.D. candidate in Physics Engineering at Louisiana Tech University, specializing in High Energy Physics with a research focus on the ATLAS experiment at CERN. Under the mentorship of Dr. Lee Sawyer, he works on jet timing and cleaning, calorimeter timing calibration, and large-scale data analysis in Run 3 of the LHC.</p>

  <p>Habeeb has over two years of experience in measuring Standard Model particles and searching for signals beyond the Standard Model (BSM). His recent work involves analyzing proton-proton collisions, developing event classifiers, and contributing to physics validation and software development in the ATLAS collaboration.</p>

  <p>In addition to his core Ph.D. research, Habeeb has participated in cutting-edge machine learning workshops through the US ATLAS Early Career Scientist group, including CAMPFIRE at Argonne National Lab and ML4FP at Lawrence Berkeley Lab, working on Z→ee identification using ML models.</p>

  <p>Before joining Louisiana Tech, Habeeb earned a Master’s degree in Applied Physics from the University of Lagos, Nigeria, where he investigated ionospheric irregularities affecting space communication systems and radio signal propagation during geomagnetic storms.</p>

  <p>He is passionate about advancing particle physics, mentoring early-career researchers, and promoting African excellence in STEM. He served as President of the African Students Association at Louisiana Tech and is a member of the National Society of Leadership and Success (NSLS).</p>
